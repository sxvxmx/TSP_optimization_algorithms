Description:

This project aims to explore and implement various optimization algorithms to solve complex optimization problems efficiently. The algorithms we will focus on are Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS), Simulated Annealing. Each algorithm offers unique strengths in tackling optimization problems, all of them will be compared on Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

1. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):
Ant Colony Optimization is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. In this algorithm, artificial ants explore the solution space and deposit pheromones on the paths they traverse. Over time, these pheromone trails guide subsequent ants to find optimal solutions. 

2. Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS):
Nearest Neighbor Search is a simple yet effective algorithm used for finding the nearest points in a given graph. 

3. Simulated Annealing:
Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It starts with an initial solution and iteratively explores the solution space by accepting or rejecting new solutions based on a probability distribution. This allows the algorithm to escape local optima and converge towards better solutions. We will apply Simulated Annealing to optimize problems with complex and rugged search spaces.
